**How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?** 
-Hardware is anything physical. Software is the brain that tells the physical what to do. So hardware is keyboards,hard drives and cd/rom. Software is apps and programs on the computer.
**What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?** 
-The ways for spies to alter hardware interdiction meaning getting the hardware while it's being shipped from point a to b. This is also very diffcult to accomplish. The second is interferring with the device directly at the source the manufacterign wharehouse. 
**Explain how the hack worked.**
-The hackers were able to infiltrate the maunfactuer factories where the server motherboards were being created and installed their own device onto the equipment allowing the customer to receive the eqipment. They did this through posing as inspectors, bribing factory management and balckmailing some with the threat of inspection. The customer is not thinking of a possible breach being that the product is coming straight from the factory. There for the customer uses the product with no sense of security due to the equipment being newly manufactere. The hacker inserts a small chip onto the mother and no is the wiser.
**How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?**
-Investiagtors were able to trace the chips back through paperwork trails and manifest. Just another example of how important and critical paperwork can be for security. By following the paperwork investiagters were able to track the equipment back to certain factories due to the specific origin of the serial number for said factories.

## Things I want to know more about
-I want to know how far has the US gotten to figuring out a defense against the chips? 
-IF we can't defend against the breach; can we prevent the breach?
- Has anyone created a to detect the breach?
- Is it possible to figure a way to detect these chips by the material they're made of?
- As advance as these chips are everything as a weakness to exploit. Food for thought or to keep you up at night.
